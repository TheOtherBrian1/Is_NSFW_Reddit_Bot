{"submissionText":["Hey there everyone, hope that you're cozy on this lovely Saturday night!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been craving physical intimacy recently. It's been partly sexual but I also just want a nice naptime or evening of cuddling with someone else. No expectations other than just cuddling and talking as necessary.   \n\n\nI definitely think that having someone who wants to meet up consistently and just exist together in that type of setting. Having a bond and building it up to a point of emotional intimacy too would be an amazing bonus.\n\nI have pictures of myself on my profile (SFW as my PFP) and I would be fine with sending more of them as needed.   \n\n\nHope y'all have a great night, take care and have the comfiest sleeps!!","\nHey, I’m a 22 year old college student who’s got both vaccines and looking for a cuddle buddy.

I’m just looking for someone just as touch starved as I have been this past year.\n\nWe could definitely meet in a public place first if that’s what you prefer, or get straight down to business. Please be willing to exchange pictures before we meet; does not have to be immediately. I’m just trynna be safe while having fun. \n\nIn terms of who I’m looking for, You need to be above the age of 18 and able to hold a conversation! If you like anime, that’s just a bonus.

(when it is covid-safe, of course) . Platonic cuddles only, any gender welcome!\n\nHow would you like to be embraced without having to do anything at all? Just being held while I stroke your hair, hug you a little more tightly every now and then. Maybe even fall asleep?\n\nI take consent very seriously. I believe it is necessary to create an safe environment where our natural barriers can relax. \n\nAlso, a slightly older but still relevant picture of me: https://imgur.com/JsKLJFP .\n\nI am basically always open for more cuddles. So even if you see this advert while it is a bit older, you can count on it that I will respond when you reach out.","My Name is Marco and I would like to find a female cuddle buddy. As it turned out, this is not an easy task in a world dominated by (often meaningless) Sex. \n\nWe can Netflix and *really* chill, or just lay in bed or on the Couch and listen to some good/relaxing music while cuddling. I'm also open for a lot of positions.\n\nIf you are interested just comment here or shoot me a DM. My body Type is \"normal\" or \"a little extra\" I guess (1,80m &amp; ca 85kg).\n\nI'm looking forward to your response :)","First of all, I have a background in psychology, and I work in healthcare.  I'm fascinated by people and the 'getting to know someone' phase.  That said, I feel a bit jaded lately in my search for long-term relationships, so this game will be my thing for awhile.  All previous posts of mine are currently on hiatus, unless chemistry from this game happens.  Also, a relevant fact is I don't like going places alone (eating, shopping, movies).\n\nOnto the game!  We go out somewhere, and you simply be interesting.  If you're interesting and score at least a '5' or higher on my scale of 1-10, I'll pay for dinner.  No obligation, no catch, no sex or twerking needed.  It's that simple.  Don't be boring, and you get a free meal, but if you are, we split.\n\nHow it's expected to go; you message me, tell me you're interested in the game, we chat until you're comfortable, if that's needed, then we move off the platform, verify, decide on a place, day, and time.  We can meet up there, or I can pick you up (I will deduct a point for this).\n\nRules:\n\nYou can suggest a place, but only I can pick.  I am partial to food places that I've never been to and sit-in restaurants as I wouldn't go to them alone.  Recently heard about magical dining in orlando, but never did it before.  I'd have made this post regardless though.\n\nYou can play the game more than once, but you will have to put in substantially more effort each try as I'd likely figure you out within the first conversation/outing.\n\nIf you like me throughout this venture, feel free to pursue that, but there's absolutely no intent on my end aside from trying more food places that I've never gotten to since I work 12-13 hour shifts daily through the pandemic (love being essential /s), up until 10/1/2021\n\nMy grading system will be kept to myself, but I will grade based on mostly your effort and how interesting you actually are.   Feel free to dress up, smell nice, or look nice, it matters for the effort.  It's an outing, afterall.  Also, feel free to lie for a free meal if you don't think you're interesting, but I'm doubtful that will work.  Or feel free to dress like you're going to walmart because you think you're 'that' interesting.\n\nIf you want to use your life's story, that's perfectly fine, but just know that I specifically work in mental health, substance abuse, and a bit of law, so I've heard pretty much everything from mild to extreme.\n\nAs I said, if you score 5 or higher, I pay for our meal, but if lower, we split the bill.  I will never stick you with both sides, even if the date was horrible or ended early.  I'm a gentleman.\n\nAny of these 'dates' will have to take place after 7:30pm ish est weekdays, or any appropriate time during the weekend until October 1st.  After October weekdays will be as early as 4:30pm est.  I work alot, but will be adjusting my schedule and working less egregious hours.\n\nI'm willing to mention my interests privately if you want, but if you want that 'cheat sheet', we have to plan a game within that week of conversation.  Can't have you cheating the game.\n\nI WILL ask personal, controversial, and deep delving questions.  If you are a very personal person, this isn't for you.\n\nLocal or simply visiting the state is fine.  If you're at a distance, you can play without the meal, for fun.\n\nWhen I grade you at the end of the outing, feel free to ask why you got the score, but know that I will be brutally honest about aforementioned score.  I will be taking notes during.\n\nLastly and most importantly, your looks, size, intelligence does not matter here.  I don't care what society thinks of you, I care about your personality and how you treat or think of society.\n\nReddit accounts need to have existed for at LEAST and month AND have a positing history.  No exceptions.\n\nAny questions, concerns, or fine print legalities can be directed to my chat.  Good luck!","I'm 22, student paramedic in London, away from my gf for some months now, feeling touch starved\n\nI want to hug someone else who needs a hug as much as me. If your lonely or isolated or struggling with some stress a hug with someone else going through the same thing is so healing.\n\nOfc it would be nice to cuddle too, but to me cuddling is something that happens in bed in pyjamas, etc. I don't want anything sexual, so if we trust eachother first, then maybe we can get into bed. \n\nSize: don't be *a lot* bigger than me (5'9 normal weight)\n\nAge: close to my age please (22)\n\nDon't mind about religion, race, class, or where your from.

I just scored another free Disney+ trial and will be keeping the subscription after it’s done this time.

Never used any sort of drugs, and free of diseases, plus fully vaccinated against *le coof.* I don’t smoke, whether it be tobacco, pot, or otherwise, nor am I friendly toward their users (I’m sorry but this is my main dealbreaker).

NOT allergic to cats is also important (we have one and he’s a longhair). Aside from that, no real requirements. \n\nMeeting in public at least once before anything else is a must for me, as I’d like to get to know you a bit before beginning any sort of arrangement, and seeing if we’ll click as friends. \n\nBeyond that, I love to cook for others, so if all goes well, you might just get a homemade dinner before a movie from time to time, plus I have a popcorn popper at home, so that’s already taken care of. If you want anything specific though, feel free to bring something if you so desire. My home has no food allergies. :p  \n**PLEASE** alert me if you have any food allergies though. I do NOT want to accidentally poison and/or kill you. That would be awkward. :|\n\nAnyway, that about wraps up everything I wanted to say here, so if this all sounds good to you or you have any questions, feel free to DM me, and hopefully we can set something up! \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you Soon™!","I'm doing research for a portfolio project of mine and I had to do some analysis to understand demand for cuddling. I got my data from [Pushshift.io](https://Pushshift.io), consisting of 12,100 submissions. I requested all submission data from September 13, 2020 to September 13, 2021. [Pushshift.io](https://Pushshift.io), although thorough, rarely documents all data between a time frame, meaning the data I have does not reflect **all** submissions throughout the year. After cleaning the data for inconsistencies, such as not putting in the appropriate flair (M4F or F4A), I was left with 7623 submissions. I was only able to filter for the following flairs: \\[M4F\\], \\[M4A\\], \\[F4M\\], \\[F4F\\], and \\[F4A\\]. \n\nIt's important to belabor that my data is questionable. My findings should be taken with caution. However, even if this shows a fuzzy picture, it should not be dismissed.\n\nFrom 7623 submissions, I found:\n\n*  6413 \\[M4F\\]\n* 363 \\[M4A\\]\n* 121 \\[F4F\\]\n*  605 \\[F4M\\]\n* 121 \\[F4A\\]\n\nAccording to the data, the sub is \\~89% male.

R/r4r was recommended to me and I figured I would give it a try. I have been on a lot of the dating apps but damn are there a lot of spam bots and crazy ppl.

I'm suggesting that we have a cuddle date (or ongoing cuddle dates) where we get to be romantic with each other. That doesn't mean sex. That doesn't even necessarily mean kissing. Though who doesn't like a few kisses while cuddling? I just mean in terms of how we interact with each other. And if while we're discussing we decide we'd be comfortable with more and want that with each other, we can figure it out together. But let's start with the assumption of romantically charged platonic cuddles.\n\nI'm 35 with a dadbod, neatly trimmed beard, dark wavy hair.

I’m not going to ask for your social media info, where you live or work. This post is just a guy who wants some semblance of warmth. A little human touch. I want to cuddle. To lie in bed (ideally nude, though underwear is perfectly fine) and feel that skin to skin contact. To wrap my arms around her… and pull her close. For my hand to navigate her soft curves. Let me be clear… I’m not looking for sex (though if we end up down that path at some point, organically… ok). This isn’t me trying to set up a cuddle session in the hopes that it will lead to something more. Cuddling is more than enough. It's everything.\n\nAs for you… intelligence is key. Nerdy is always a plus. Age/race open. I don’t care if you’re slender or full figured. All women are beautiful, regardless of cup/waist size. I care about the size of your brain. I care that you’re a nice person and that you’re also looking for a connection of some sort. No expectations.\n\nAs for me… thoroughly average. 53/WM (look 30s). Corporate type. I’m not tall. I’ve had a few too many cheeseburgers during Covid, so… I’m not gym-fit. Pretty laid-back. Zero pressure from my end. Happy to meet up first for coffee or a drink (assuming anything’s open; I feel like I’ve been in a bunker). Will get a Covid test prior (had one a week ago; negative result, but it came back positive on me being a goof).\n\nIf this sounds good, feel free to DM me. If not… no worries. Hope you find what you need.","Really just looking for someone to hold right now, I do not care who. I also don't care if we do more than cuddle.","Casual nun serious\n\n(M4f)","I recently decided I want to start getting out, having fun, and start dating.

I love true crime, romance, comedy, and horrible reality tv. I do like to talk though and hear about your day, what you want to accomplish, and just who you are as a person. I enjoy social drinking when I'm not home, going to the beach, and finding new restaurants to try. \nUnfortunately can't host.

I've been COVID vaccinated since April. 6' tall with strong arms and legs to wrap around you. When not cuddling I enjoy hiking, drinking good coffee, exploring new restaurants, going to Giants games, or biking around the city. I make chocolate and wine as hobbies and have a good supply of both at home. I train dogs as a hobby, including bringing out their affectionate side to create a better bond with their future human.\n\nI've cuddled with women in the past who held back their full cuddle monster out of fear it might scare him away. Or cuddling felt like a short blip in someone else's pursuit of something more sexual. She might never have been with someone who enjoyed her affectionately expressive side and her cuddle monster within has not fully emerged. I like releasing that full cuddle potential, either in a short burst with me or sustained over a lifetime once you realize what's possible.\n\nI enjoy cuddlers who don't just lean against someone but instead find new ways to be wrapped up in my arms or wrapped around me. You should bathe regularly, realize when your many layers of clothing can be abrasive or inhibiting, recognize when your extra long hair presents a choking hazard, and be a generally easy-going person. I'm open to increasing our shared activities beyond cuddling to city exploring, road trips, and more if we get along.\n\nI realize you may be cautious about laying close to someone's lungs after keeping your distance for so many months, making closeness a bit scary even as the fog rolls in and you crave melting into someone and the sound of a thumping heart. We could start with a walk outdoors, in a park or through a neighborhood, sharing some food or wine and conversation before relaxing with touch. Watch a movie at home in good company or have a snuggle sleepover. Or simply get to know each other knowing there's a cuddle monster within eager to fully express herself once she's a bit less afraid to emerge.\n\nCurious if a good cuddle buddy is possible and enjoyable?

POST IS NOW OUTDATED!!\n\n~~So I’m gonna try to keep this brief...~~\n\n~~Hi there! I’m looking for someone roughly around my own age to cuddle up in front of a movie with, as the title says. I live in OC, however I work in the IE so I’m also open to meeting up with people in the Corona/Riverside area, though I won’t be able to host in the latter case.~~\n\n~~I’m very introverted and can be socially awkward before I know someone well enough to let out my goofy side, so I have very few friends around my own age, and there’s absolutely zero intimacy in my life... I’m not actively searching for a relationship; if something grows naturally, cool, however the big thing I’m looking for is just to curl up on the couch with someone and watch a movie or a couple episodes of a sitcom either after work or on a day-off... I just need the human contact. Should be implied given this is a cuddle sub, but clothing stays on, I’m not comfortable with getting more intimate than that.~~\n\n~~I’m absolutely fine with meeting out in public the first time for introductions and getting to know one another first (in fact it’s actually preferred), and with sharing my name and face over DMs as well.~~\n\n~~Uh, a couple brief facts: I’m an ISTP and a Gemini (if you’re into that stuff), I’m 6’1 and around 250lbs (neither completely muscle nor completely squishy, but a bit of both), and fully vaccinated! You can find out a lot about my eclectic interests in my post history, but suffice it to say, i’m a massive nerd. I love to laugh, and going back and forth with jokes is one of my favorite things to do. I also love to cook, especially for other people, so if you ever come to my house for a movie, you’ll very possibly get a homemade dinner first. When cuddled up, I’d kinda like to feel like I’m protecting someone... but also just relaxing together is fine too. I’ve only ever cuddled with someone once before many years ago and I really want to feel that closeness with someone again...~~\n\n~~Anyway, this is getting long enough. I hope to hear from you soon!~~","Looking for a CB age range (25-35). I have a lot of interests, but we can save that for when we link up.

Some people ease my anxiety and make me smile and my life is better bc they're in it. I want to know more of these people. These relationships can't be forced, even if we want them to be. Some people click and that's great. If there's stress or other negatives involved it's not worth pursuing. \n\nLaughing and smiling is much more frequent and exponentially better when shared. The same goes for cuddles- if you doubt me, try to cuddle yourself. It just doesn't work. \n\nI like reading and writing and just chilling. I've had a tough couple years and it would be a real blessing to find someone who is trustworthy and empathetic. \n\nMy friends, and even acquaintances would say I'm a very sweet and kind person and I'm looking to spend time with someone who is as well. \n\nHolding hands or cuddling and watching a movie can be so great and great for emotional and mental health. \n\nSex can be great but real intimacy is a lot more than that, and I think it's overvalued. \n\nI have a couple post-graduate degrees and I appreciate people who have passion(s) and like to learn about them, caring people, people who value other people far more than money, confidence, eccentrics, artists, genuine and honest people. Really sweet girls are a treasure. \n\nContrary to the cute snoo picture above we needn't jump right into bed, maybe we'll never get there. Real friends are a treasure too. \n\nPhysical chemistry can be important and we should be honest if we feel a spark or not, as our time is valuable. \n\nA friend reminded me there's a meteor shower in a couple weeks. It may be an ambitious goal, but, if I camp this year, I'd love for it to be with a cute sweet girl who makes me smile. \n\nAn empty bed can be as lonely as an empty tent. \n\nI'm vaccinated and disease free, open-minded, well-read. I like Bob Dylan, ballads in general, Grateful Dead, Tom Robbins, Hunter Thompson, politically left of center.....and cuddling :)  May have drifted from the point here. \n\nA cute, sweet, cuddly girl who I can make smile and vice versa would make life a lot better. \n\nAge is often just a number. \n\nIf you found any of this interesting, maybe we have some cool stuff in common.

It's nice to meet you all!\n\nI'm a twenty year old college student from Pennsylvania, and I'm looking for a female snuggle buddy! I'm an empath (someone who is exceedingly emotionally focused, put simply), and the lack of physical contact over the last year has worn me down.

Looking for cuddles,  massages or napping together, but happy with anything really, I'm also  looking for someone to see bands with, or movies.\n\nI'm living in a sharehouse but can host if preferred.\n\nI'm okay keeping things platonic and happy to discuss boundaries.",null,"Hey, first of all thanks for reading my post. I hope you are good. \n\nI'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit so I'm talking out of my heart right now. \n\nI hope it's okay if i just start with what i feel right now after that i will describe myself for sure :) \n\nFollowing your heart is very important and i always tried to do that. I believed in myself, tried to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. Even if I'm slightly more extroverted i like to be silent too and just listen to somebody. This year was very tuff tbh. I guess everybody can say that. Never felt so alone, never felt so down and never thought i would have such a bad depression that i even had very dark thoughts in my mind. Since the beginning of Corona I'm working as a restaurant manager (nothing fancy, just a Subway) because things didn't worked out as i thought it would be, after finishing my apprenticeship as a salesman. I'm starting a new job soon, so I'm greatful that i even had a job where other people struggled to pay their bills. Still, it was not easy to accept the situation and feeling like not making any progress in life. \n\nI moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. I don't know but i always had a lot of people around me. I miss that for sure. It's not about having many friends, just in general to have a good friend i guess. I thought a lot about my past, who i am (i have turkish background but raised and born in Germany) and what i want to be. Life in general, God and where i come from. I always thought i know all that but apparently these questions are not that easy to answer as i thought.. If I learned one thing is that I don't want to judge anybody again, you never know the circumstances or what that person really feels inside. Another big part in my life is my wife. We got married very young and she is the first woman to be on my side. Back then i had to fight for my marriage, because my family didn't wanted to accept her. We met at a time where we both needed each other. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. Our marriage is having a very hard time and since Corona we are more like two people just living together. Feels like the harmony is gone.. I don't get the love and attention i need, we are fighting over the slightest things and divorce is often discussed. I'm physically and emotionally frustrated. So, with that being said, I'm really missing to be loved. I don't know how i should name it, but it's just what i feel. \n\nAnyway.. i guess these lines are a little bit messy and confusing, so let me tell a bit about my interests :) \n\nI want to share things of my life, joy or sadness, talk about anything that comes to our mind and maybe do things together, gaming or watching a movie? Maybe you have an idea!\n\nI am 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, have dark eyes/dark hair and a naive face. I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT 👨🏻‍🍳 since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my \neating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D \n\nI hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can understand and be understood or even help each other if needed. \n\nIf any of these lines made you curious or if you felt connected, please reach out! don't forget, honesty is very important.. i had some encounters with fake people and since then it's even more important for me (if you want i can verify myself). Please take some time to describe yourself a little bit rather than just a \"hey\" and i promise I won't ghost you! :)\n\nThank you for reading, hope to hear from you 😇","Hey,\n\nI’ve been unsure how to post on here.

I'm suggesting that we have a cuddle date (or ongoing cuddle dates) where we get to be romantic with each other. That doesn't mean sex. That doesn't even necessarily mean kissing. Though who doesn't like a few kisses while cuddling? I just mean in terms of how we interact with each other.

I am a very lenient person, and in return, I ask for your best effort at strong communication and sincerity. 😊\n\nI'm interested in music (I play the guitar although I am rusty). I'm also interested in photography, tech, video games, and business.

Regardless of the outcome, I wish you a lovely day or night. And if no one has said this to you recently, I believe in you! ❤️\n\nI'm really open to anything that isn't sexual, I'd love to just spoon in bed or snuggle up and watch a good movie, or play games or really any other activity that we can enjoy together and bond over.

As the title of this post suggests, my wife and I are looking for a potential new long term best friend and hopeful cuddle buddy. We have a number of good friends in our lives but my wife has never had a true female best friend, someone that she can talk to consistently about anything and everything, so here we are, searching now.\n\nA bit about us, we are both somewhat nerdy, into video games and anime and we have a lovely little 3 month old boy who takes up all of our time at the moment. I personally am studying Japanese at nights, and I have a love of writing, music and watching/playing sports. My wife is much more likely to be found spending her free time drawing or watching Disney+.\n\nMy wife and I are particularly affectionate people, and one thing we are really hoping for is to find someone who is happy to be in a friendship which could one day involve a lot of cuddling and mutual support. So if you think that could maybe be you, feel free to hit us up :)","Asian, 5’11” 155lbs, fit and cute, educated and working full time in tech, fully vaccinated (Working from home).

I like doing that same with getting to know a new person as well.\n\nI should note I am a very romantic and chivalrous guy, with a rather affectionate side. I blame my grandmother for instilling manners and southern social values into me.\n\nI'm 6'3\", average, blue eyes and brown hair. I am a graphic designer. I play league on occasion, but i love any kind of music, electronic music is a big passion of mine and like to make my own music. I love camping and hiking.

There are but a scant few things in life I feel I am genuinely good at, perhaps even gifted, and besides Mario Kart, cuddling is one of those things. I am 6’, large frame but average weight, strong arms. I will make you feel safe, and like you are the only other person that exists in the world. I have no age preference (aside from over 18, obviously). I am trans-friendly. I am down for platonic or non-platonic cuddling (though, if you like being caressed, at the very least, I think that is a plus). I prefer to host (I am not a big fan of driving). Also, I am nocturnal, so late night hours preferred, but we could probably figure something out what works for both of us. Fair bit of warning though, every girl I have ever cuddled has fallen asleep in my arms, I get told frequently that I am very comfortable. Basically, I am just someone that loves human contact (who doesn’t), and who has a gift for cuddling that I would like to share.","27 year old average white male in Bushwick looking for a cuddle buddy, prefer women around my age","21 yo female close to hillsborough and polk county.

I grew up in a very religious and sheltered life. I have always felt curious,  but shourd away from girls all together. Lately, I have decided to start doing life my own way. I am totally okay with something totally platonic, if that's what you want. While I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about more, I can semwear that a good cuddle is all I really need. I am absolutely drawn with the idea of just having someone to hold, and to feel the presence of someone with me. As for me, I am 29, slim build, average height, and I have been told I am cute by a lot of girls in the past, but I have always been shy to accept those compliments. I would love to hear from anyone interested, I am very open, and if you want to see a picture of what I look like, or just chat a bit first, whatever you're comfortable with, I'm happy to do it too.

I've been told that I'm a great listener and that I give goo back  massages, so those maybe a plus. I'm into all types of music except for  country (but if there's a fast paced country song, then I might be  willing to try) but as of right now I'm heavy into either fast paced  rap, pop or rock/metal. There's no pressure or need for things to turn  sexual at all, but if we do hit it off or something, it's not off the  table.\n\nA little bout me is that I'm 25, 6'3, half Indian mix, I have a beard and I look like gentle giant.\n\nIf this appeals to you, I'd love to hear from you :)\n\n1 comment","Hey everybody, I'm Nila from Belgium and I have a dream.\n\nI want to educate and engage people in Europe to cuddle more.

I try to not talk about this stuff tho, bc I know it’s not fun. I should say if we hypothetically meet up I’ll talk don’t worry, it’s hard to explain which is why I normally don’t mention the mute ish thing but ya. I’m best described as a selective mute \n\nI should probably mention some more upbeat stuff huh lol. I’m 6ft tall, 175ish pounds, white. Brown hair and eyes. Probably no point in going further since this is mainly for friendship? I’ll send selfies to you tho if you want I don’t mind. I will say most girls think I’m pretty attractive and my body is athletic. I have a chocolate lab puppy, which takes up most of my free time lol. I enjoy reading, watching Netflix, listening to podcasts/audiobooks/music, going on walks, nature, playing games, true crime, animals, space stuff, philosophy, idk there is probably more. I’m passionate about lots of stuff and I love learning lmao. I’ve been teaching myself Spanish which is fun. It’s been 6 or so months. Not fluent tho but I think I’ve learned a lot! I’m a pretty emotional/affectionate/sensitive guy tbh. My friend didn’t like it tho unfortunately but idk it’s just the way I am. I’m super caring, empathetic and compassionate yk. Not sure what else to say I can go on forever tbh. Oh I’ve been mediating every day for like 90 days, it’s made a pretty big impact on my life tbh. In general I do really want to be happy, normal and just enjoy life, I try super hard to work on myself every day. I have problems, mental illnesses and issues I gotta deal with but that’s ok \n\nUm so yeah feel free to HMU if you wanna talk! Thanks for reading it means a lot.

But I must say, I apologize to all the women who get overwhelmed and all the me that are underwhelmed. I hate that ... Well I hate having to be alive.\n\nI posted this post initially and accidently F4M and wondered why I had immediate responses until I looked. But please don't be mad at men. We aren't good at socializing. We don't have friends who buy us ice cream and let us cry from a broken heart. Us reaching out... It's just trying to connect to someone who will nurture and love us, even if we mistake our feelings for being horny. Which the sex solves nothing even if we think it does.\n\nPost:\n\nI want to snuggle close to you. While you're asleep I want to burry my face through your hair into your neck.

I'm pretty much ready for anyone 😅","Houston area 24YO M4F want to cuddle with someone for the first time ever lol yeah i know kinda sad but been alone forever 😅","So it's hard to know where to start... I'm very disorganized in my writings, so I apologize. Yes, English is my first and only language. Yes, I'm a certified dumbass.\n\nTo begin with I think it's nice to talk about what I like about cuddling, and sharing a connection with someone without sex. I usually don't make r4r posts because 99% of the replies I receive prospect sex, or sexual things at some point.\n\nI feel like it's really easy to get sex? Like, it seems like most adults meet up and have connections to have mutual sex. But I find it *way* more intimate and meaningful to get as close to someone without crossing that line. \n\nI like to be able to be naked around someone, and the best of all taking nice, hot, luxurious baths with a person. (Oh yeah, that's right. I'm talkin' bath bombs, Epsom salts, and bubble bath! Maybe even candles!) It's hard to find someone to be comfortable with because I understand that most people want to have sex when you're cuddling naked and usually take my intimacy as a \"next step.\" \n\nBut my ideal person enjoys getting as close as possible without that sexual need from me. If I find someone I really connect with, and feel really comfortable with, I love to cuddle nude like I said. But might like to do things like straddle-hugging nude, or even sitting on laps/hugging and touching nude. (But not touching genitals, of course. I'm talking like, arms, back, shoulders, ect.) Sometimes I love to nuzzle my face in a neck and appreciate your smell, who knows. Like I said, it really depends on how comfortable I am with someone. I don't enjoy kissing or making out though.\n\nI'll even enjoy talking about sexual subjects sometimes. I enjoy hearing about other's sexual experiences, and tastes/fetishes. Hugging someone and giggling about past sexcapades, or fantasies can be really fun. I'm a painfully open person, and have been told I've no filter. \n\nI really love things like massages as well, giving and receiving. I've never been intimate with a cis woman before, but imagine it would be really cool to pamper her in ways like having a bath together, helping her shave her legs, lotioning her whole body afterwards, and if you've long hair I'd love to brush and play with it, maybe paint your nails after if you'd like that. (Of course if you're a dude and want the same treatment, I'm totally down)\n\nI appreciate dudes as well, since most are always bigger than me. Something feels so right feeling a warm, fleshy body spooning mine and being able to wrap all the way around my back/butt. Feeling the warmth and breathing. I love feeling like a smol bean. But no discrimination, of course. I love dudes of all height. (I'll even argue that people my own height give the BEST hugs) \n\nI like watching horror movies as well, and I'll protect you from the big, scary ghosts with my incredibly intimidating 5'2\" 115lb frame. I'm smol, but still soft after going through two pregnancies. I'm still pre-everything as well, but should be starting testosterone soon. \n\nI love to go out and hangout too, but don't get to do that often. I enjoy simple things like walking on a nature trail. Or sitting outside somewhere and smoking some doobs. I also really loving fishing and haven't gone yet this year since I don't really want to eat anything from Lake Ontario. (Oh yeah, if you took me on a fishing trip I'd totally gut/clean and cook a fish for you on a fire. I'm a butcher by trade. 😏) \n\nI don't drive, but can host sometimes. I might be able to host sometimes, I'm from Niagara region in Ontario. Please nobody from Buffalo.\n\n I also don't mind people who know nothing about LGBTQ+ people, but please don't message me and use female pronouns or compare me to women because of the fact I happen to possess bubs and vagine.

Hopefully you can and if you have animals, don't worry. I love animals and would love it if they joined us. All I ask is that you're clean and sane. I don't really care if you're quiet or talkative, however I can be pretty quiet myself. I think watching something on Netflix would make the awkward silence between two quiet people way less awkward and who knows cuddling may be a great ice breaker. With that being said, we don't have to rush into cuddling. We can move as slowly as you're comfortable with.\n\nI've never done this before, but would love to get to know someone and possibly make this an ongoing thing if it's something we're both enjoying.

(Your natural body as evolution gave you).  \n- Doesn't smoke or get drunk, (a few drinks is okay).  \n- Isn't interested in having kids anytime remotely soon. (I'd do basically anything for someone I love, so if you do eventually want kids we can do that).  \n- Homebody. I would like to go for semi-daily walks though for health reasons.  \n- No cosmetic surgery, major deformities, or missing limbs. (Most other disabilities I'd probably be cool with).\n\nI'm very shy and uncomfortable with other people, so even if you do live close to me, I'd like to get to know you online first. I'm clingy and would really like to eventually have a co-dependent relationship where you never want to leave my side. I like the idea of sending a picture doing a particular task to confirm to each other who we are, and not just a google search, such as an L on our forehead with head tilted down menacingly 🤣. My ideal day/first date with you would be to play some Minecraft for several hours, then spend the rest of the night cuddling and watching some comedy/action/sci-fi/fantasy shows/movies.\n\nI (somehow) graduated top of my class grade 12, even though I basically dropped out 1/3 of the way into the second semester. I had a mental breakdown, involving a girl not reciprocating feelings, the future, getting a job, becoming independent, and more. I haven't recovered since then, on account of it being easy for me to get by monetarily with my simple daily requirements, but me being useless isn't great for my mental health. I need you, my soulmate, to be my motivation to take on the world. To find something I'm passionate about and make a living with. to support me through everything whilst I support you as well. Can you be the one to balance my equation? 😉\n\nThanks for reading about me!\n\n- Hunter","Hello!

Granted I would ultimately love to find a relationship or even a night being more intimate, cuddling is a large part of both of those for me. I’m very respectful and won’t bring up anything more than cuddling because if I can get just that I’d be grateful. I can host if needed but prefer to travel to someone reasonably nearby.

I'm fully vaccinated and very cuddly. Obviously, given that I posted here, I am only looking for cuddles. I am asexual to begin with, so I wouldn't be interested in anything more anyway.

What you need to know, I've been touch starved for a really long time, and I would really love to just be held. I would like to be the little spoon, but I'm open to other positions. I just want someone who will hold me, not judge me, say nice things to me while playing with my hair, and listen to me ramble about what's going on in my life. Not looking for sex, just some intimacy that makes me feel less alone in the world. Body size/ethnicity/sexuality does not matter. I just want to feel safe, secure, and cherished. (Different SSC than you may be used to)\n\nI'm 6 foot flat, weigh about 215 with a dad bod, have short hair, and lots of tattoos. Hopefully I'll hear from you soon.

Well here I am. If you’re interested, let’s talk and see about setting something up.","I really need someone to cuddle, not sex or anything just cuddle. Because of the pandemic people are not as physical as i am used to...","I made a post here about a year ago and thought I didn't get any responses, but I recently logged back on to this throwaway account after a long hiatus to a bunch of chat message I couldn't see before. I feel bad that I missed them, but at least it gives me hope to try again!\n\nSo, yeah, looking for physical contact. Even just hugging and holding hands would be nice, but I'm guessing anyone who's on this sub wants a little more than just hugs. No need for anything sexual, I'm just more comfortable being physically intimate with a woman.

Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nEdit: Just in case I lose chat messages again, it would probably be best to contact me through private message first.","Hey there. I am 29 and on the hefty side.

I’m an open book for questions!\nThank you!!","Reach out to me here, dm or chat is fine.","A shot in the dark here in the odd chance you see this...\n\nHey, I want an entrepreneurial boyfriend.\n\nYou don't have to be rich but you have to actually started a business you own. I figure we will have things in common. I can relate. I'm entrepreneurial too, I understand. You're winning or learnt something, there are no losers.\n\nI want a partner. There is no point of me reaching the top of the mountain with no one to share the experience with.\n\nPeople who will put in genuine work and choose to go through the struggle know how it changes your life, mindset, and values. True entrepreneurship is lonely and unglamorous.\n\nI personally find that very attractive and beautiful. I hope you do too.I believe entrepreneurship creates certain values in people and I would want someone who shares my same values. I want someone who supports, trusts and understands the risks I might take.\n\nThe reality it's hard to find like-minded individuals in this specific area unless you started as a couple who started their business together. Especially as a female, my age is rare in my area. Statistically, entrepreneurship puts a strain on all relationships, not just romantic. In general, men tend not to place too much importance on or care about a woman's career. I find it's not the primary quality that attracts them to me.\n\nVulnerability is sexy. I promise to say directly what I mean and be upfront about what I want. I know we are busy but we will make time to see each other.\n\n**Edit:** \n\nMost qualities and values I find important or ask for here, I already bring to the table. Humans are complex and dimensional. I can take a compliment but I feel like making declarative statements about myself, it's like humble bragging, and I cringe a bit. I pride myself on having integrity; meaning and doing what I say in all aspects of my life. I prefer to be judged from not only what I say but my actions. I Just figured, you know, anything you wanted to get to know about me beyond this post, you would message me and we would talk.\n\nMost people would say: I'm an intelligent, kind, attractive, passionate, etc but these are superficial that don't things that don't define me, any stranger or acquaintance might observe these traits. From those who are close to me, I'm touched when they notice the small things. I enjoy looking beyond the surface of things, especially with people. I'm patient on getting to know people on a deeper level beyond their favorite show, especially if we have some chemistry going.\n\nOutside of my entrepreneurial pursuits, you don't need to share my hobbies. It is your unique personal differences that will balance me. \n \n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* I'm eager to meet you as soon as possible and so are you. So living locally helps. Like in Ontario....in the GTA.\n\n* You are or plan to be a homeowner. And you drive your very own car.\n\n* You're a healthy, virile male that is 28 -36 years old.\n\n\n\n**Bonus:**\n\n* You are health conscious and\\or fit like me, that's a bonus. I'm 5'5\" (5'10\" in heels)and a guy taller than me is fine. I like eyes, smiles, and ...dimples are another bonus.\n\n* Do you have a secure attachment style and practice open communication? Props if you even understand what I'm even talking about.\n\n* You understand life is not a competition.\n\n* You put energy into things you can change and not into the things you can't. You have an internal locus of control.\n\n* You're glass half full type of guy. Only because my internal optimism might annoy someone who is the opposite, but you don't mind, you can apply too.\n\n\n**Hints (Things that make me swoon):**\n \n* I really enjoy voice messages on WhatsApp but I'm even more blown away with phone /voice calls. There is just something about a voice that just leaves me speechless ;P\n\n* I am usually the friend people go to for advice and emotionally depend on but not the other way around. Secretly I'm hoping to find someone who can do the same, or sharing our feelings mutually.\n\n* I believe real connections are made outside of social media. I don't believe differences in favorite media, music and food are important in potential compatibility.\n\n* I like guys who are awkward, shy, honest, sweet, and compassionate.","Been feeling lonely, I would love to hang out and just snuggle up to someone and get all warm. Watch a movie, get a pizza, etc. Haha might be cheesy, but that’s me haha.","Hello!\n\nI'm a normal dude whos a bit on the heavier side and works in IT. I usually carry a relatively short and trimmed beard and wear glasses.\n\nI'm looking for a lady who, perhaps, like me feels a bit touch starved and deprived of the closeness of another human being, who'd want to be a cuddlebuddy with me. We could watch movies and shows together or just hunker down and talk over some peace and quiet.\n\nMy preference would be some one who's older, calm and more mature.

It’s been a little while since I’ve enjoyed a good cuddle so very keen to meet someone equally eager. \n\nWe can watch films, play games, sing terribly, eat all the snacks and chat about whatever pops into your mind - whether that’s deep thoughts about how the world works or whether you think pineapple belongs on pizza or need to vent and seek comfort or advice. \n\nI’m built to cuddle - very chubby, so extra comfy to snuggle into. \n\nHappy to hear from people 18+, other than that I have no preferences as long as you’re friendly. Pop me a message!","Looking for someone to relax and mutually cuddle. Perhaps developing into an ongoing cuddle buddy/friend, lets just see how things go. For instance it could turn into a regular thing or simply impromptu from time to time, or whatever works out. I have flexible hours and days at current, so I can work around schedules to some extent. \n\n\n\nIf you have any requests and whatever your personal boundaries are please say them upfront. As I’d want this to be safe and enjoyable for both of us, also all boundaries will be respected and not pushed. Which sort of goes without saying. \n\n\n\nI’m open to most body types/ages etc, but please don’t smoke and I’m also allergic to strong perfumes. As for a basic physical description of myself, I’m roughly about 6f tall and average build around about 67kgs at current. Along with some beard, which I'm willing to trim based on your preference. I'm happy to exchange photos after a little bit of conversation.\n\n\nI will add as just a random pointer that I am on the high end of the spectrum, which doesn’t really have that much relevance. But has some effect, for instance I’m sensitive to sounds to some degree. So might ask for the tv to be quieter, if we’re lounging around watching Netflix for example.\n\n\nUnfortunately I can’t host at current aside from rare occasions. Hopefully you can host, or we can come to some working arrangement. I do live south of the river, so might ask to meet you at a train station as well. For rough travel distance I’ll say perth-mandurah &amp; surrounding area.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, I’m not really sure if I expect anything to come of this but figured I’d try. If you actually do stumble onto this post and have any questions, please feel free to ask.","Looking for a chilled day of cuddles and movies and take out… keen hit me up. Just in one of those cuddly moods","36F looking for a guy to exchange mutual cuddles. I live alone in a 2 bedroom apt, I can host, overnight's OK. 420-friendly and happy to share my stash. Don't care how big or tall or thin or small, as long as you smell good, have arms to hug me with, and a smile on your face. \n\nI'm open to hugs, snuggles, spooning, and laughter while watching  funny shit on my laptop. Futurama, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Legends of the Hidden Temple, Disney movies from the 90s, etc. \n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I'm 5'2\" and weigh 220. No kids/never pregnant, but I've had weight loss surgery and couldn't afford plastic surgery. I'm lumpy. Also fun :)\n\nIf we both agree, making out isn't off the table, but explicit consent would be required. \n\nThanks for reading, even if this comes to nothing. I don't expect it will come to anything, but why not give it a try? I don't judge based on weight or looks, but I'd appreciate a pic so I know it's safe to open the door.","It’s actually my birthday today and normally I never like people making a big deal out of it. But I recently moved into the area which was lonely to begin with, and I guess for once I do want a little attention for my bday, so I just really want some quality time with someone. \n\nI’m 25M Asian, short and kinda stocky. I feel like my past and current interests/ambitions are pretty interesting, but unfortunately my field requires some discretion so you’ll just have to meet me to find out!\n\nAs for who I’m looking for — no preference really in age (18+ obviously lol), ethnicity, or height (I’m ok with you being taller), as long as there’s a mutual attraction. Anything beyond cuddling/making out is up to your comfortability. \n\nWell that’s just about it! DM for any questions/interest, and maybe SFW pic swaps. I’m off at 5, heading to the gym, and I’ll check back after. Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nEdit: fully vaxxed and can host","Looking for platonic cuddling? Nothing sexual at all! I am a straight male interested in cuddling a woman. I miss holding someone. We can get to know each other first in public. Whatever would make you feel comfortable and confident.

I’m up to cuddle and hang out doing whatever, I can travel but cannot host. Feel free to DM me and ask anything. We can get food and watch whichever movies or TV you like, or relax in silence and chat about whatever.\n\nThe reason I’m looking for someone to cuddle with is I haven’t shared any physical affection with a women in a little over two years, it’s really starting to take a toll on my emotional state and mental health.

Double bonus points if cute and like dogs. \n\nI can’t host and not really down to cuddle in a car. \n\nI enjoy watching cartoons, disney movies, romantic/comedy kdramas or anime.

It doesn't help that I'm super physically frustrated. This frustration is making things even worse, because it's giving me a funk and I'm so much more likely to screw things up with a date (I go on plenty).

The 2 main aspects I am looking for is someone who likes to game and someone who likes to cuddle. \n\nThe first will allow us to hang out and get to know each other until we can arrange to meet up in a safe matter. So on that note I don't expect you to be pro tier gamer as I am no where near that myself. I game mostly on PC and abit on Switch Some of my favorite games are Skyrim, Factorio, Minecraft, Breath of the Wild, Warframe and recently got back into plating GTA Online and City of Heroes. I have a vast library of games too so we can probably find something to play together. \n\nOutside of gaming I am still a nerd, I play D&amp;D(Although alot less since Covid) I enjoy the MCU and Star Wars. I tend to enjoy action and sci fi movies and series aswell. \n\nOnce we both feel safe I would like to work towards the second. In this aspect we can setup rules and limits to make us both feel comfortable and get maximum enjoyment of our time together and although I would like to get phsyical that is not a must if you do not feel comfortable. \n\nFor what I look like I am 6' tall white and have developed a dad bod over covid but luckily my job is keeping me in somewhat of good shape. I've been told I have a cute or handsome face by my ex's but you can determine for yourself. I've got some pics on my profile for reference. Personality wise I'm an introvert and very independent.  I can both silly and serious which has caused some miscommunication with people in my past. I have some levels of anxiety and depression( which who these days don't) but I am very adept with dealing it myself. \n\nWell that's enough of a rant for now, if you have any questions feel free to ask.","Hey i'm just looking for someone to cuddle.

I love cartoons, snuggling, and just relaxing as I have a stressful job. I am a bit of a loner, but super friendly, easy going, and open minded. I don't know what else to write, but I love questions :)\n\nI do like to be a little boy more, but can easily switch to a daddy as well if you need him. A daddy role is natural for me due to my tall frame, so that's easy.

I used to make a lot of YouTube videos and short films and might get back into it at some point. Let's go down a YouTube rabbit hole.\n\nI also know too much about old games and outdated media. Games and consoles. Old ways to play movies that never took off.\n\n19 and up please. No body preference, everyone is welcome (Tall, short, green, blue, thin, chubby, cis, trans, NB).

Except if it's about pineapple on pizza, maybe.\n\n**I am a dreamer.** I devour fantasy novels for breakfast. I dive into new worlds in video games, or watch other people get thrown into them. I'm a D&amp;D GM and it's a joy to come up with new places for my players to expore. I want the world to be better a place, and sometimes, that means dreaming of one.

What about **you**?\n\nWell, it'd be nice if you were in Europe. I'd like to actually meet you, eventually - I don't mind a long-distance relationship, but it shouldn't stay that way forever.

Yes times are changing spiritually, and it is somewhat akin to the end times but it will be nowhere near as bad as people think considering the nature of consciousness is basically an individuals plot armor and they’ll realize they can take anything this world throws at them as long as they trust themselves and if they believe, god. Otherwise people will slowly realize divinity lives in all things(some would call this quintessence of reality), and much of the organized religion of the world has corrupt intents along with the government and all of the other institutions of illusions.\nHMU if you wanna chat, I feel like id be an intellectually engaging stay at home dad for ya if you don’t want a 3time divorced retired old white dude or someone/something new and fresh entirely! 😊😂😂\nI’m tired of 99.99999% of my matches on dating apps being fake scams or people se . -lling .
